# Specialist Handoff: Design Lead

**Project:** Kingshot Atlas  
**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**From:** Atlas Director  
**To:** Design Lead  

## Task

Update Atlas Score content across the website with simple, user-friendly explanations that align with the new comprehensive formula.

## Goals

- [ ] Find all Atlas Score references across the website
- [ ] Update copy to be simple and accessible (not too technical)
- [ ] Ensure brand voice consistency (competitive, analytical, direct)
- [ ] Add tooltips and microcopy where helpful
- [ ] Test content clarity and readability

## Constraints

- Must follow brand guide terminology (Atlas Score, KvK, Domination, Invasion)
- Keep explanations simple - no deep statistical jargon
- Focus on user benefits, not technical implementation
- Maintain competitive gaming tone
- Don't over-explain - keep it punchy

## Context

The Atlas Score formula has been comprehensively reworked to eliminate bias and include all required variables (streaks, recent performance, etc.). Users need to understand the new scoring system without getting overwhelmed by technical details.

**Key changes to communicate:**
- Experience now matters more (early kingdoms penalized)
- Consistency over lucky streaks
- All performance factors included
- More accurate rankings

## Success Criteria

1. **Clarity:** Users understand what affects their Atlas Score
2. **Simplicity:** No technical jargon or complex explanations
3. **Consistency:** Brand voice maintained throughout
4. **Helpfulness:** Tooltips and microcopy add value
5. **Completeness:** All relevant content updated

## Files to Review

- `/apps/web/src/pages/` - Page-level content
- `/apps/web/src/components/` - Component tooltips and labels
- `/docs/BRAND_GUIDE.md` - Brand voice reference
- `/ATLAS_SCORE_COMPREHENSIVE_BREAKDOWN.md` - Technical reference (keep simple)

## Expected Deliverables

1. Updated Atlas Score explanations across all pages
2. Simple tooltips for score components
3. Consistent terminology usage
4. User-friendly score breakdown displays
5. Content audit report
