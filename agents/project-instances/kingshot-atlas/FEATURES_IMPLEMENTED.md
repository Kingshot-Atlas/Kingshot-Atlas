Discord permission verification via `verify-guild-permissions` Edge Function (MANAGE_GUILD check). Timezone toggle (UTC + local time preview). Admin management UI (add/remove by Atlas username). Event history log (last 50 sent reminders with status). Custom reminder range 0–60 minutes (presets + custom input). Reference date picker for recurring event cycles. Bear Hunt corrected to "Every 2 Days". Auth: sign-in + Discord link + MANAGE_GUILD required. (2026-02-22) |

| Bot Dashboard 500 Fix | ✅ Fixed | Supabase trigger functions `fn_bot_guild_auto_owner` and `fn_bot_guild_default_events` were missing `SET search_path = public` on SECURITY DEFINER functions.

(2026-02-22) |
| Bot Dashboard 401 Fix | ✅ Fixed | `BotDashboard.tsx` `fetchDiscordGuilds` was missing `Authorization: Bearer` header when calling `verify-guild-permissions` Edge Function.

| Partial KvK History Submissions | ✅ Built | Progressive KvK matchup updates: users can submit matchup-only (Sunday after matchmaking), then add prep winner, then battle winner.

Supabase RPC `submit_kvk_partial()` handles insert + update of both mirror records atomically. New `KvKMatchupSubmission.tsx` component with auto-detection of existing records and mode switching. KvK Seasons page: "Add Matchup" button for logged-in users, partial matchup cards with dashed border + status badges (Matchup Only / Prep Done / Awaiting Battle). `scoreHistoryService` updated to handle null prep/battle results. `MatchupWithScores.is_partial` flag.

| KvK Phase Schedule System | ✅ Built | `kvk_schedule` table tracks per-KvK phase timestamps (matchups_open_at, prep_open_at, battle_open_at, is_complete). `kvk_matchup_reports` table for user-submitted error reports with RLS. `submit_kvk_partial` RPC enforces: user must own one of the kingdoms (non-admin), phase-based restrictions via schedule timestamps, prevents overwriting existing results. pg_cron job `auto-increment-kvk` runs every Saturday 00:00 UTC to auto-create next KvK schedule and mark previous complete. Seeded KvK #10 (complete) and #11 schedules. (2026-02-23) |

Matchup Reports review: load/resolve/dismiss user-submitted reports from `kvk_matchup_reports`. (2026-02-23) |

| Bot Dashboard v4 — Access Control | ✅ Built | Replaced "Admins" tab with "Access Control". Anyone with Discord Manage Server permission gets dashboard access by default.

| Discord Welcome Message Overhaul | ✅ Built | `bot.js` `guildMemberAdd` handler: embedded message → plain text. 20 concise variations with Atlas personality copy (competitive, data-driven).
