## 2026-01-30 23:45 | Product Engineer | COMPLETED
Task: Multi-kingdom comparison + Profile fixes + Mobile UX
Changes:

## 2026-01-30 01:30 | Platform Engineer | COMPLETED
Task: Fix production API 404s and console errors
Root Causes:
  1. Render ephemeral storage wipes SQLite DB on restart → API returns 404 for all endpoints
  2. Font preload URL outdated (Google Fonts version changed)
  3. Supabase tables don't exist (expected, code handles gracefully)
Files:
  - apps/api/main.py - Added ensure_data_loaded() on startup to auto-import if DB empty
  - apps/web/public/index.html - Removed stale font preload URL
Result: API will repopulate data on each cold start; font 404 fixed; Supabase errors are benign

## 2026-01-30 01:20 | Product Engineer | COMPLETED
Task: Fix Kingdom Profile "Kingdom not found" error for valid kingdoms

  - apps/web/src/services/kingdomService.ts (lines 140-164) - Same fix applied
