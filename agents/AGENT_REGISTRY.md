## Brand Compliance (MANDATORY)

**All agents MUST follow the brand guide when creating or updating any user-facing content.**

### Reference Document
`/docs/BRAND_GUIDE.md` - The authoritative source for brand voice, personality, and messaging.

### Brand Voice Summary
| Trait | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Competitive & Gaming-focused | Speak to players who want to win | "Stop guessing. Start winning." |
| Analytical & Data-driven | Facts over opinions, results over rumors | "Data-driven dominance" |
| Direct & Punchy | No corporate fluff, get to the point | "No more blind migrations" |
| Community-powered | We're players, not a corporation | "Built by Kingdom 172 players" |

---

## Critical Setup Requirements (MANDATORY)

**All agents MUST review `/docs/CRITICAL_SETUP.md` before any deployment or database work.**

### Key Requirements
1. **Database Setup:** Always run `/docs/migrations/recreate_profiles.sql` for new setups
2. **Service Worker:** Never cache external resources - causes CSP violations
3. **Avatar CORS:** Use `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"` for Akamai CDN images
4. **Schema Cache:** Run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'` after table changes

### Common Issues
- Kingshot Player Linking not persisting → Missing database columns
- Avatar images not loading → CORS issue with Akamai CDN
- CSP violations in console → Service worker caching external resources
- Supabase 406/400 errors → PostgREST schema cache outdated

---

## Terminology Standards
| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| KvK | Kingdom vs Kingdom (after first use) |
| Prep Phase / Battle Phase | Preparation Phase / Combat Phase |
| Transfer Event | Migration Event |
| Atlas Score | Rating / Points |
| Domination | Double win |
| Invasion | Double loss |
| S-Tier, A-Tier, etc. | Top tier, high tier |

## Director Autonomy

The Atlas Director can make certain decisions independently:

### ✅ Auto-Approve (No Owner approval needed)
- Bug fix prioritization
- Specialist assignment
- Task sequencing
- Documentation updates
- Minor improvements

### ⚠️ Needs Owner Approval
- New feature development
- Breaking changes
- Strategic direction changes
- Major architectural decisions
- External integrations

### 🚨 Escalate Immediately
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data integrity issues
- Production outages
- Blocking resource constraints

---

## Patch Notes Schedule

The **Release Manager** compiles user-facing patch notes **every 3 days**.

### Process
1. Read all agent worklogs from past 3 days
2. Filter for user-relevant changes
3. Categorize: ✨ New, 🐛 Fixed, 🔧 Improved
4. Publish to `/docs/releases/PATCH_NOTES_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
5. Update `/docs/CHANGELOG.md`
6. Post to Discord via `POST /api/discord/webhook/patch-notes`

### What Gets Included
- ✅ User-visible features
- ✅ Bug fixes users noticed
- ✅ Performance improvements
- ❌ Internal refactoring
- ❌ Code cleanup
- ❌ Agent system changes

---

## Coordination Protocol

### Starting Work
```
1. READ STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md     → Current state
2. CHECK FILE_CLAIMS.md        → No conflicts
3. SCAN ACTIVITY_LOG.md        → Recent history
4. CLAIM files before editing
5. LOG "STARTED" in ACTIVITY_LOG.md
6. DO the work
7. LOG decisions in worklog
8. RELEASE claims
9. LOG "COMPLETED" in ACTIVITY_LOG.md
10. UPDATE STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md
```

---

## Pre-Task Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before starting ANY task, ALL agents MUST:**

### 1. Check Vision Alignment
Read `/docs/VISION.md` and verify the task:
- [ ] Helps players make better decisions
- [ ] Maintains data integrity principles
- [ ] Aligns with competitive-but-fair values
- [ ] Core users would find this valuable

### 2. Check If Already Done
- Search `FEATURES_IMPLEMENTED.md` — Is this already built?
- Search `ACTIVITY_LOG.md` — Was this recently completed?
- Grep codebase for existing implementations

**If already implemented:** Inform user and suggest enhancements or alternatives instead.

### 3. Check For Conflicts
- Review `FILE_CLAIMS.md` — Are target files claimed?
- Review `STATUS_SNAPSHOT.md` — Any blocking dependencies?

### File Claiming Rules
- **Check before editing** — Never edit a claimed file
- **Claim before starting** — Add claim with timestamp
- **Release on completion** — Remove claim when done
- **2-hour expiry** — Stale claims can be overridden by Director

---

## Handoff Protocol

### When Director Invokes a Specialist

1. **Prepare Handoff Document**
   ```markdown
   # Specialist Handoff: [AGENT NAME]
   
   **Project:** Kingshot Atlas
   **Date:** [Date]
   **From:** Atlas Director
   
   ## Task
   [Clear description]
   
   ## Goals
   - [ ] Goal 1
   - [ ] Goal 2
   
   ## Constraints
   - [What NOT to do]
   
   ## Context
   [Relevant background]
   
   ## Success Criteria
   [How we know it's done]
   ```

2. **Specialist Reads**
   - Their `SPECIALIST.md`
   - Their `LATEST_KNOWLEDGE.md`
   - Project files in `/project-instances/kingshot-atlas/`
   - The handoff document

3. **Specialist Works**
   - Claims files
   - Executes task
   - Logs decisions
   - Stays within scope

4. **Specialist Returns**
   - Summary of changes
   - Files modified
   - Decisions made
   - Follow-up recommendations

---

## Post-Task Requirements (MANDATORY)

**After completing ANY task, ALL agents MUST:**

### 1. Update Feature Registry (If Applicable)
If you implemented a new feature or significant enhancement:
- Add row to `/agents/project-instances/kingshot-atlas/FEATURES_IMPLEMENTED.md`
- Include: Feature name | Status | Date | Agent | Notes

### 2. Document Knowledge
Record all relevant information that must be known by yourself or other agents in the future:
- Technical decisions and rationale
- API endpoints, secrets, or configurations discovered
- Gotchas, edge cases, or lessons learned
- Dependencies or prerequisites for future work

**Where to document:**
- Agent-specific: Update your `LATEST_KNOWLEDGE.md`
- Project-wide: Update `/docs/` or relevant documentation
- Cross-agent: Update `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` if it affects coordination
- Features: Update `FEATURES_IMPLEMENTED.md` for new capabilities

### 3. Provide Summary Report
Deliver a concise report including:
- **What was done** — Clear description of completed work
- **Why it was done** — Business/technical justification
- **Key decisions made** — And their rationale
- **Files changed** — With brief descriptions

### 4. Provide Suggestions
Offer 3 actionable suggestions for next steps, each including:
- **Relevance** — How it connects to completed work
- **Utility** — What value it provides
- **Priority reasoning** — Why it should (or shouldn't) be done soon

**Format:**
```markdown
## Suggestions

### Option A: [Title]
- **Tasks:** [5 specific tasks]
- **Relevance:** [Connection to completed work]
- **Utility:** [Value provided]
- **Priority:** [Why now or later]

### Option B: [Title]
...
```

## When to Invoke Specialists

### ✅ DO Invoke When
- Task requires domain expertise
- Work spans multiple files
- Quality/consistency is critical
- Specialized workflows add value

### ❌ DON'T Invoke When
- Single-line fixes
- Trivial updates
- Director has sufficient context
- Urgency outweighs specialization

---

## Communication Flow

```
Owner
  ↑↓ Strategic decisions, approvals, direction
Atlas Director
  ↓  Task assignments, handoffs
  ↑  Status updates, completions, blockers
Specialists (Product, Platform, Design, Ops)
  ↓  Worklogs, activity logs
Release Manager → Patch Notes → (Future) Discord → Users
```
