## Key Points (as of 2026)

### Intellectual Property
- Kingshot™ is a trademark of Century Games
- All game content, names, imagery, and materials are the intellectual property of Century Games
- Fan projects must clearly state they are independent and not affiliated with Century Games

### Gift Codes
- Official gift code redemption is handled in-game via Settings → Gift Code
- Century Games operates an API at `https://kingshot-giftcode.centurygame.com` for code redemption
- Third-party auto-redemption proxies operate in a grey area under ToS

### User Content
- Screenshots and game imagery are copyrighted by Century Games
- Community sites should acknowledge this when displaying user-submitted game content

### Atlas Compliance Actions Taken
1. **Removed auto-redeem proxy** — Atlas no longer proxies gift code redemption through Century Games API
2. **Display-only gift codes** — Atlas aggregates and displays codes; users redeem in-game manually
3. **Screenshot disclaimer** — Users must confirm ownership of screenshots and acknowledge Century Games copyright
4. **Trademark attribution** — Site-wide footer and About page explicitly state Atlas is independent and not affiliated with Century Games
5. **Terms of Service** — Atlas has its own ToS at `/terms` that covers IP attribution, user content, and disclaimers
