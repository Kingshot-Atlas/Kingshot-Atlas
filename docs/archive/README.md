This directory contains historical documents from January 2026 that predate significant architectural changes. They are retained for context but **should not be used for current decision-making**.

## Why Archived

These documents reference outdated infrastructure and terminology:
- **Netlify** → migrated to Cloudflare Pages
- **Railway** → migrated to Render
- **SQLite-only** → migrated to Supabase (dual-database)
- **Atlas Pro / Atlas Recruiter** → rebranded to Atlas Supporter (single tier)
- **Placeholder auth** → migrated to Supabase Auth
