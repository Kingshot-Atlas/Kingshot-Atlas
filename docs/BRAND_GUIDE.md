## Brand Identity

### Mission
Empower Kingshot players to make data-driven decisions for KvK matchups and kingdom transfers.

### Vision
The definitive analytics platform for competitive Kingshot players.

### Origin Story
Built by a Kingdom 172 player who was tired of making transfer decisions based on rumors and Discord hearsay. Tired of walking into KvK blind. Tired of guessing. So he built the tool he wished existed: a place where every kingdom's track record is laid bare. Real data. Real results. No spin.
