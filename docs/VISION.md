# Kingshot Atlas — Vision & Mission

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15  
**Version:** 1.1

---

## Tagline

**"The most robust intelligence platform for Kingshot players."**

---

## Mission

Kingshot Atlas is the analytical hub for KvK opponent scouting and efficient kingdom exploration for transfers. We give players the data they need to make informed decisions—no guessing, no rumors, just facts.

---

## Origin Story

**Founded:** January 25, 2026

The game has no clear way to rank kingdoms or know which are better than others in a clear, irrefutable way. Players looking to transfer had no reliable source. The in-game transfer chat is a mess—too many messages, most not serious. Discord and Reddit are inefficient. Direct recruitment is cold-calling at best.

Atlas was built to solve this. One place. Real data. Clear rankings.

1. **Deep analytics** — Not just data, but meaningful insights
2. **Beautiful, understandable presentation** — Complex data made accessible

## Strategic Priorities (Current)

1. **Data coverage** — More kingdoms, more accuracy
2. **Core tools** — Kingdom search, Atlas Scores, KvK scouting
3. **User experience** — Fast, beautiful, intuitive
4. **Community building** — Discord, feedback loops, trust

---

## Decision Filter

Before any feature or change, ask:

1. **Does this help players make better decisions?**
2. **Does this maintain data integrity?**
3. **Does this align with our competitive-but-fair values?**
4. **Would our core users find this valuable?**

If the answer to any is "no" — reconsider.
