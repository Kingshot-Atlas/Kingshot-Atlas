### Day 2: Recruiter Call-to-Action
```
📢 **Recruiters: Your kingdom needs a listing.**

If you're an R4/R5 or alliance leader, claim your kingdom on the Transfer Hub and set up your recruitment profile. Players are already browsing.

Funded kingdoms rank higher. Even $25 gets you Bronze tier with requirement filters and vibe tags.

👉 https://ks-atlas.com/transfer-hub (switch to "I'm Recruiting")
```

### Day 3: Transfer Profile Reminder
```
🚀 **Transferring soon? Don't wing it.**

Your Transfer Profile is how kingdoms see you. Fill it out completely — TC level, power, language, what you're looking for. Better profiles = higher Match Scores = better offers.

Takes 2 minutes: https://ks-atlas.com/transfer-hub
