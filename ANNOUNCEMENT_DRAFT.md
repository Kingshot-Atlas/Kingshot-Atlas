## Discord Announcement

� **NEW TOOL: KvK Prep Scheduler is LIVE.**

Your Prep Manager is juggling a Google Sheet, a 500-message Discord thread, and a headache. We fixed that.

**The KvK Prep Scheduler auto-assigns buff slots based on who brings the most value.** Players submit their speedups and availability through one link — the system handles the rest.

🛡️ **What it does:**
• Collects speedups, availability & proof screenshots in one form
• Auto-assigns 30-min buff slots by speedup type (Construction, Research, Training)
• Flags unassigned players and empty gaps instantly
• One-click export — ready for Discord or in-game chat

⚡ **How it works:**
1. Editor assigns a Prep Manager
2. Prep Manager shares the form link with the kingdom
3. One click → optimized schedule → export → done

👑 **This is a Gold Tier kingdom perk.** Your kingdom needs Gold status through the Kingdom Fund to unlock this tool. Not Gold yet? Rally your alliance leaders to contribute.
